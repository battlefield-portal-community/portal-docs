    "summary": "Returns a constructed **Message** object which can be used with **DisplayGameModeMessage**, **DisplayNotificationMessage**, **DisplayHighlightedWorldLogMessage**, and **DisplayCustomMessage**. The **Message** object is created by providing a **Number**, **Player**, or format **String** (which can take up to 3 format items).  \nA format **String** is a **String** that contains `{}` (called braces) within them, which can be substituted for parameters. For example, the **String** - `{} gained {} points!` - can be given a **Player** and **Number** parameter and could output as `John gained 2 points!`. See the example below for how this can be used with blocks.  \n  \n_Note: It's your responsibility to ensure a safe and fair experience for others, violating the EA User Agreement by using offensive or inappropriate text may result in account bans._",
