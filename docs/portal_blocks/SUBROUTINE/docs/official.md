**SUBROUTINE** blocks are special blocks that are similar to **RULE** blocks, but do not have a designated **EVENT**. A **SUBROUTINE** block's **ACTIONS** will be executed when called from the **RULE** block. Like **RULE** blocks, **SUBROUTINE** blocks can have a **CONDITION** to determine whether or not the **ACTIONS** inside should execute.
  
  An important note is payload values, including **EventPlayer**, **EventOtherPlayer**, and **EventTeam**, use the context of the **RULE** block in which the **SUBROUTINE** instance block is placed in. An example of this would be, if your **RULE** block has an instance of **EventPlayer**, and the **SUBROUTINE** is called in **OnPlayerDeployed**, it would use the **EventPlayer** associated with **OnPlayerDeployed**. Be careful with this, as you will run into errors if your **SUBROUTINE** is placed inside a **RULE** block with non-existant payloads for that **EVENT**.
