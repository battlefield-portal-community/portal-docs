Returns a filtered version of the specified **Array** based on the condition provided. This block cycles through the entire array. You can utilize the **CurrentArrayElement** block to represent the element in the **Array** for each iteration. For an **Array** like **GetPlayers**, **CurrentArrayElement** would represent each **Player** in that **Array**. You can then build your filter condition based on a property of that **Player** (like score, or some custom player **Variable** value).
