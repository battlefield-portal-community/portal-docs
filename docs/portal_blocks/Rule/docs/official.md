**RULE** blocks are triggered from an in-game **EVENT**. When an **EVENT** triggers, this block will check if its **CONDITION** has been met and then execute all of the **ACTIONS**.  
**Types of **RULE** Blocks Events**
**Ongoing**
Ongoing **EVENT** types continually check if its **CONDITION** has become **_True_**. If so, the **ACTIONS** will be executed once. In order for the **EVENT** to execute again, the **CONDITION** must become **_False_** before becoming **_True_** again.  
   
Ongoing **EVENT** types currently exist within the context of:  
  
- **Global**  
- **Player**  
- **Team**  
- **Vehicle**  
- **CapturePoint**  
  
Within the **Player** and **Team** contexts, payload value blocks, such as **EventPlayer** and **EventTeam**, can be used to refer to the specific **Player** or **Team** within the **EVENT**. _Note: In FFA, Ongoing **Team** will not execute at all._
