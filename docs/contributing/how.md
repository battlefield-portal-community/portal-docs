First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This file contains a few guidelines on how to contribute to the community made portal docs hosted at [docs.bfportal.gg](https://docs.bfportal.gg)

These are not rules but just some suggestion, so feel free to propose any change in the project

{{< toc >}}

## Architecture of the docs

The project is split into two parts:

- The docs themselves, written in markdown and located in the `docs` folder
- The website, built with [Geekdocs](https://geekdocs.de/) and located in the `hugo` folder

---

The **docs** are also split into two parts:

- The docs that are hand-written and located in the **`docs`** folder
- The docs that are generated using the **`portal_blocks_documentation`** module.

  - The process to generate new docs for portal blocks is pretty much automated

  - The official documentation for each block is retrieved and saved to the **`docs/portal_blocks/<block_name>/docs/official.md`** folder

    - Any changes to this file **will be overwritten** when the docs are regenerated

  - The **`docs/portal_blocks/<block_name>/docs/extra.md`** file is where you can add extra information about the block
    - This file will **not be overwritten** when the docs are regenerated
