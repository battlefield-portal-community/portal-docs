For example, the **String** - `{} gained {} points!` - can be given a **Player** and **Number** parameter and could output as `John gained 2 points!`. See the example below for how this can be used with blocks.  \n  \n_Note: It's your responsibility to ensure a safe and fair experience for others, violating the EA User Agreement by using offensive or inappropriate text may result in account bans._", "inputs": ["1. **String** | **Number** | **Player**", "2. **String** | **Number** | **Player**", "    **_Optional_**", "3. **String** | **Number** | **Player**", "    **_Optional_**", "4. **String** | **Number** | **Player**", "    **_Optional_**"], "output": ["-   **Message**"]}
